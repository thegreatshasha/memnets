### Coding Conventions
* First write the comment then code. There should be a comment every 4-5 lines
* One should be able to understand the program entirely from the comments
* While defining matrices, please also write down the dimensions next to it

### Todo
* Try it out on small babl tasks
* Try it out on bigger babl tasks
* Implement multiple hops
